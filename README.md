# The-Maze-Project
This project was done as part of the "Advanced Topics in Programming" course. In this project I created a maze, a matrix of zeros and ones, so that one represents a wall in the maze and zero represents a path through which you can pass. In addition, I created a class that generates a maze by "Recursive division method", one of the "Maze generation algorithm" as you can see here-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm.  
  
In the project there are three search methods - Breadth-first search, Depth-first search and Best-first search. So that we can adapt the game problem, the maze, to the classes of the different search methods and we can perform a search of these methods in the game, I used the adapter design pattern. Given additional games, I will be able to adapt the above search methods for it with the help of this design pattern. With the help of these search algorithms it is possible to look for ways to solve the maze.  
  
The selection of the search algorithms will be done at runtime according to the bridge design pattern. After implementing a maze and ways to solve it, it will be possible to compress the data of the maze and transfer it from the client to the server, so that the server will solve the maze according to the above search methods, and then return a solution to the client.
